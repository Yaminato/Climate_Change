            <h1>Understanding Climate Change</h1>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, human activities have been the primary driver since the 1800s, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

            <h2>What Causes Climate Change?</h2>
            <p>The main causes of current climate change include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Burning Fossil Fuels:</strong> Coal, oil, and gas release greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere</li>
                <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Trees absorb CO2, so cutting them down reduces nature's ability to regulate the atmosphere</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Activities:</strong> Manufacturing and industrial processes release significant amounts of greenhouse gases</li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Livestock farming produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas</li>
            </ul>

                    <h3>🌡️ Rising Temperatures</h3>
                    <p>Global average temperatures have increased, leading to more frequent and intense heatwaves affecting human health and ecosystems.</p>

                    <h3>🌊 Sea Level Rise</h3>
                    <p>Melting ice caps and glaciers cause sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities worldwide.</p>

            <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
            <p>Everyone can contribute to fighting climate change:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce energy consumption and switch to renewable energy sources</li>
                <li>Use public transportation, bike, or walk instead of driving</li>
                <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle to minimize waste</li>
                <li>Support sustainable and local products</li>
                <li>Plant trees and support reforestation efforts</li>
                <li>Educate others about climate change</li>
                <li>Advocate for climate policies and regulations</li>
            </ul>
